*a framework for implementing application-level rate-limiting middleware for Django projects*

   :alt: Built Status

What this module is intended for:
=================================

Implementing application-level (or just below) rate limiting, with the ability to create rules such as:

* an IP address may make at most 1500 requests/day

* users with an OAuth access token may make 500 reads/hour and 200 writes/hour


What it is not intended for:
============================

A token bucket or leaky bucket filter: those algorithms are intended primarily for traffic shaping, and are already well-served by using ``nginx`` or one of its peers as a frontend to your app. Also, those algorithms require a single, high-granularity system-wide timer to implement leaking - that would make distributing the algorithm much more difficult.
